The application lists photos saved in your personel album
You can list the photos, upload a photo, update, delete a photo

Technologies and packages I used on the FRONT side:

## React

Edit your dotenv file, and replace the SERVER_URL with the URL of your server.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
